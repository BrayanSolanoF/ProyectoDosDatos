Hello guys today I’m going to talk about computers, first at all a computer is a human invention  that makes more easy our way to live, if we want talk about their history the computer as we know it today had it’s beginning with a 19th century like analytical engines.
Generally speaking computers can be classified into three generations.
-First Generation from 1937 to 1946 designed to process a single task and also based on military purpose.
-Second Generation from 1947 to 1962 introduced  to the public the first commercial computer.
And the last one but not the least the third Generation from 1963 to the present at this generation the integrated circuit was implemented and computers became smaller to reach the computer of nowadays but trying to develop a lot of task at the same time.
In conclusion, personality thinking actually a computer became a personal and daily use device for everyone, because help us to communicate to each other, do our different tasks and also it’s the principal tool to many people’s job for example my case in a near future I hope haha
